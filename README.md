# react-native-snow
Fullscreen snow overlay component for React Native.  This can be used in any
view (but should only be used in one place) and this will place a fullscreen
overlay of snow on your app, making it easy to apply and remove.

If you are enthusiastic about winter weather or the winter holiday season, you
can make your app festive very easily with this component!

This is heavily inspired by [http://pajasevi.github.io/CSSnowflakes/](CSS
Snowflakes) (it is
basically a React Native port with some tweaks).

Many thanks to Pavel Ševčík ([https://twitter.com/pajasevi](@pajasevi) for
the inspiration!
